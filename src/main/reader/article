Changing Expectations mission is to provide the highest impact STEM
and computer coding programs to inspire Black and Hispanic youth
to pursue computing careers. Our programs are designed to study
and increase Black and Hispanic studentsâ€™ interest, engagement, learning, knowledge, sense of
belonging and identity, and intentions to persist in STEM and computer science education and careers,
including artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
In support of our mission, we provide Information Technology (IT) support
services by creating work-based learning opportunities through a
Paid Pre-Apprenticeship for Black Youth.
